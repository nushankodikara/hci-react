This document contains all the necessary information pertaining to the assessment of PULS3122 
HCI, computer graphics and visualisation. The module is assessed via 50% coursework and 50% 
exam. This document provides a specification of the coursework. The sections that follow will 
detail the assessment tasks that are to be undertaken. All assessments are to be submitted 
electronically via the respective DLE module pages before the stated deadlines.  
  
All assessments will be introduced in class to provide further clarity over what is expected and how 
you can access support and formative feedback prior to submission. This coursework requires 
students to form teams of five (5) to six (6) members to carry out the following interactive software 
development exercise: Develop a project with suitable user interface (UI)/ user experience (UX) 
design for the given scenario available in appendix A.  
  
The aim of this coursework is to apply the theoretical concepts learned throughout the course in a 
practical scenario. With this coursework, you will get an opportunity to exercise your user interface 
design abilities. You are required to design and implement a software solution for the scenario 
specified in Appendix A. You should follow an agile software development life cycle. You are 
encouraged to follow the Scrum methodology.   
  
Based on the given scenario, you are required to implement a software solution and document the 
software development process used. That includes analysis, design, implementation and 
evaluation of your solution. To do this you must:   
  
• Analyse the scenario to identify the context of use and the user(s) of the system.  
• Gather your own requirements and add them to the requirements supplied to you in this brief. 
Use all of these requirements to develop your solution. Use the method(s) and technique(s) 
you were taught during the module.  
• Develop user stories and personas to bring the requirements to life.  
• Design the UIs of the system based on the requirements. Keep in mind the design/usability 
goals and principles you were taught during the module:   
o Produce a low-fidelity prototype and storyboard/s for the design of UIs. Use these to 
gather initial feedback on your initial designs.   
o Subsequently, produce a high-fidelity prototype which addresses the feedback you 
gathered during the initial evaluation. You are encouraged to use software such as 
Figma (see https://www.figma.com/prototyping/) for prototyping.  
• Carry out both formative and summative user testing.  o Invite at least two potential users to 
each study.   
o Set up a user study based on the knowledge you gained during the module using 
one type of ‘user testing’ that you were taught.   
o Consider how to incorporate the user feedback back into your software solution to 
enhance it.  
• Implement the design of the UIs, produce these using the Java programming language using 
the swing APIs and the integrated library of computer graphics. Use of any other language will 
receive zero marks.  
  
Report  
As a group, submit a report describing your work. This must be a single PDF file uploaded to the 
DLE submission point for this module, no other submission type will be accepted. Please NOTE 
that all your work should be described in the submitted PDF file, a link to a separate folder/ 
file that holds your work will not be accepted and will result that the submission will not be 
marked and receives ZERO marks.  
  
  
 Your group report should include:  
  
• The design of the UIs (sketches and/or screenshots)  
• Details of the usability evaluation carried out. Include all the details of each study such as 
test plan, methods/techniques used, and participants’ demographics. NOTE: Children 
should not be involved in this study, and participants’ identity should never be 
disclosed.   
• A link to the GitHub repository for your project. It is your responsibility to make sure the 
link to the GitHub repo holds all of your code and that it is accessible.  
o I recommend you ask each group member to check this as it is very important.  
• A link to the YouTube video presentation of your application, highlighting the main 
requirements and explaining related blocks of your Java coding (submit as group).   o In the 
video, the group should demonstrate the software developed running with data.   
o Each member of the group must appear clearly in the video to highlight their part of the 
development.   
o The video should be in the normal speed.   
o It is your responsibility to make sure the link to the video is publicly accessible.  
  
More details about the report:  
This should be a single PDF document describing your work. NOTE: all your work should be 
described in the submitted PDF file, a link to a separate folder/ file that holds your work will 
NOT be accepted and will result that the submission will NOT be marked and receives 
ZERO marks.  
  
The PDF file should document all the details of the design, implementation and evaluation studies 
that were carried out. That includes:  
- UIs design (low and high- fidelity prototyping)  
- Details of the implementation phase providing a justification for your choice of design 
solution.  
- Information about the user studies, participants who took part in the study, how they were 
invited and the consent form.  
- How the user testing studies were set and conducted, details on the methods/techniques 
that were adopted, evidence of the study setting (you may use photographs), and full details 
of the user testing plan.  
- An explanation of how the user feedback help enhance the software solution (i.e.  
recommendations).   
  
More details about the video:  
Video rundown of your application:  
- Demonstrate the functionality of your project in a short YouTube video (this should be a 
group submission). A link to the YouTube video should be included in the main document. 
No other submission type will be accepted.  
- NOTE: It is the responsibility of each group member to test the link ensuring the 
video is accessible. No other video type/submission method will be accepted.   
 The video should be between 7-12 minutes long. Please note the marker will stop the video 
after twelve minutes, so anything after that will not be marked.  
- Please make sure you do the following:  
o Explain any design solution. o  Go through the code and explain your 
implementation briefly.  
o Demonstrate the program running with data.  
- You may be invited to an online video call for further discussion at a later date

Appendix A  
  
  
  
Product Vision  
A designing furniture company wants to develop a desktop application for their customers in order to 
enable them to view the furniture that the customers interested to buy in order to design it for their 
rooms, and based on the size, colour schemes and the shape of the rooms, which would enable them 
check sizes and colours if they do fit in the rooms. The furniture they sell are chairs, tables (dining, 
sides, etc.). The required app is to be used by the designers in the store when customers come to 
visit to show them final expected look of the rooms that customers are intending to design some 
furniture for. Designers should be able to login into their account. The design involves putting 2D 
shapes together and view it in a 3D format.      
    
Functional Requirements of the admin side (designers):   
- I wish to provide the size, shape and colour scheme for the room.  
- I wish to create a new design. Based on the room size, shape and colour scheme - I wish to 
visualise the design in 2D.  
- I wish to visualise the design in 3D.  
- I wish to scale the design to best fit the room.  
- I wish to add shade to the design as a whole or selected parts.  
- I wish to change the colour of the design as a whole or selected parts.  
- I wish to save the design.   
- I wish to edit/ delete the design.
